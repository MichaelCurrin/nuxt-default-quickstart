This project uses Yarn, JavaScript (no TS), Nuxt, Vue and Vue templates. This project uses server-side rendering with Node, but also comes with the option to generate a static site.

Content is in the [pages](/pages/) directory as `.vue` files.

## Installation

Install dependencies

```sh
$ yarn install
```


## Usage

Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

```sh
$ yarn dev
```


## Deploy

### SSR

Build for production and then launch the Node server.

```sh
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

### Static

Generate static build output in `dist` directory. This can be deployed as a GitHub Pages site. 

```sh
$ yarn generate
```

Recommended:

- Add a `deploy` command to `package.json` as per docs.
- Or use GitHub Actions to build the site and commit the site to `gh-pages` branch.

See info on [GitHub Pages deployment](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/deployment/github-pages/) in the Nuxt docs.

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).


## Create a fresh project

See the [Getting Started / Installation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation) Nuxt docs for more info.

This project was generated with this command:

```sh
$ yarn create nuxt-app nuxt-default-quickstart
```

All the default options were used, as follows:

```
âœ¨  Generating Nuxt.js project in nuxt-default-quickstart
? Project name: nuxt-default-quickstart
? Programming language: JavaScript
? Package manager: Yarn
? UI framework: None
? Nuxt.js modules: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
? Linting tools: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
? Testing framework: None
? Rendering mode: Universal (SSR / SSG)
? Deployment target: Server (Node.js hosting)
? Development tools: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
? What is your GitHub username? michaelcurrin
? Version control system: Git
```

Username became lowercase even though entered as `MichaelCurrin`. The app suggested `Michael Currin`, perhaps from git name rather. I don't know how this gets used.
